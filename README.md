## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher (v22 recommended)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 or Docker Compose
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your local settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to open your new `.env` file and fill in your:
> 1. **SMTP Mail** credentials (e.g., a Gmail App Password) so that the system can deliver OTP verification emails.
> 2. **Cloudinary** credentials (`CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`) to enable video and media uploads.


### Step 2: Launch Infrastructure (Docker)

To spin up the MySQL database quickly:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode (watch mode)
npm run start:dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## 📖 API Documentation

The backend is fully documented and testable out of the box.

### 1. Swagger UI
Interactive documentation is available at:
👉 Local: **[http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs)**
👉 Live: **[https://backend-lms-0kw1.onrender.com/api/v1/docs](https://backend-lms-0kw1.onrender.com/api/v1/docs)**

### 2. Postman Collection
For dedicated API testing, import the collection found in:
📁 `docs/postman/TalentFlow_LMS.postman_collection.json`

> [!TIP]
> Registration now requires email verification. The expected flow is: **Register -> Verify OTP -> Login**.
> The Postman collection automatically handles JWT storage! Just run the **Login** request after verifying your email, and all subsequent authenticated calls will use the captured token.

## 🔍 Database Management

To view and manage the underlying MySQL database in your browser:
1. Ensure the Docker containers are running: `docker compose up -d`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to: **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.
3. Use the following credentials to log in to **phpMyAdmin**:
   - **Server**: `mysql`
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Password**: `password` (matching the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in your config).

---

## 👑 Admin Seeding

For security reasons, the public registration endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/register`) only allows for **Student** or **Instructor** roles. To create an initial **Admin** user:

1. Ensure your database is running.
2. Run the pre-configured seeding script:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:admin
   ```
   *Note: This script will create a default admin with the email `admin@trueminds.io` and password `superadmin123` if it doesn't already exist.*

## 📂 Folder Structure

## ✉️ Notifications & OTP System

The platform includes a robust **One-Time Password (OTP)** verification flow and an asynchronous notification system.

- **Verified Users Only**: New users cannot log in until they verify their email via the `/api/v1/auth/verify-otp` endpoint.
- **Secure Password Recovery**: Users can securely reset forgotten passwords using the `/api/v1/auth/forgot-password` and `/api/v1/auth/reset-password` flow.
- **Context-Aware OTPs**: The system uses a `purpose` flag (e.g., `VERIFY_EMAIL`, `RESET_PASSWORD`) to ensure OTPs are used only for their intended action.
- **Transactional Outbox Pattern**: To guarantee email delivery, OTP emails are not sent synchronously during the request. Instead, they are safely written to the `outbox` database table within the same **database transaction** as the associated user update.
- **Background Worker**: A scheduled background cron job (`@nestjs/schedule`) continuously scans the outbox and delivers pending emails (Verification or Password Reset) using NodeMailer, complete with automatic retries for failed deliveries.

---

## 🎥 Video & Media Uploads

The platform supports high-performance video uploads powered by **Cloudinary**.

- **Stateless Streaming**: To avoid taxing the server's disk space, video files are streamed directly from the incoming request buffer to Cloudinary using `streamifier`.
- **Validation**:
  - Max File Size: **100MB**.
  - Allowed Formats: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`.
- **Usage**: Upon a successful upload to `/api/v1/media/upload/video`, the API returns a secure HTTPS URL. This URL can then be saved as the `contentUrl` for a Lesson in the Courses module.


---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- **Bcrypt Hashing**: All passwords are salted and hashed using Bcrypt before being stored.
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using secure JSON Web Tokens.
- **RBAC**: Fine-grained access control using `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)`.
- **Validation**: Strict input validation using `class-validator` and global `ValidationPipe`.

---

## 🏥 Health Check

The API includes a dedicated health check endpoint to monitor the system status and uptime. This is also used by Cloud hosting providers (like Render) to verify the service is running correctly.

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/health`
- **Live URL**: [https://backend-lms-0kw1.onrender.com/api/v1/health](https://backend-lms-0kw1.onrender.com/api/v1/health)

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-31T14:55:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 12345.67
}
```

## 🏗 Moving Forward: How to Use This Boilerplate

This repository is a **living template**. Here is how to expand it:

### 1. Creating New Modules
Use the Nest CLI to scaffold new features in seconds:
```bash
npx nest g resource courses
```

### 2. Adding Entities
Ensure your entities utilize the decorators from `typeorm`. Once created, register them in their respective module using `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([NewEntity])`.

### 3. Protecting Routes
Simply add the `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` decorator to any controller or method that requires authorization.
